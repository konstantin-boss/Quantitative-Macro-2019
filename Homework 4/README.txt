There is still a lot missing from the code and from the documentation. I will work on this more in the coming days. 
I have the brute force versions running with concavity and monotonicity of the policy function exploitet (also at the same time) and a start for the Chebyshev as well. The VFI for elastic labor is still a bit buggy because it is quite sensitive to the starting grid.
