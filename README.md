Download all data tables to your preferred location and change the respective paths in the Python code.
Data are taken from the following BEA/NIPA sources (variable name in code in brackets):

GDP (GDP_annual)                                                            = Table 1.1.5, line 1
Taxes - Subsidies (tax_subsidies_annual)                                    = Table 1.12, lines 19,20
Net Mixed Income (NMI_annual, in part 4 shortened series called Prop_inc)   = Table 1.12, line 9
Intellectual Property Products (IPP_annual)                                 = Table 5.2.5, lines 19, 47
Compensation to employees(CE_annual)                                        = Table 1.12, line 2
Corporate Business Income (Corp_inc)                                        = Table 1.13, line 3
Corporate Compensation to employees (Corp_CE)                               = Table 1.13, line 4
Corporate Taxes - Subsidies (Corp_TS)                                       = Table 1.13, line 9
Corporate Net Mixed Income (Corp_NMI)                                       = Table 1.13, line 8
Net Fixed Assets (Fixed_assets)                                             = Table FA 1.1, line 2
Net operating surplus (NOS)                                                 = Table 1.10, line 9

All data should be annual, net and in billions of USD. Unless otherwise indicated the data are from the GDP & Personal Income tables of NIPA. Running the code should output a total of seven graphs with corresponding legends.
